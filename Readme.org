** Three projects
Let's create 3 simple Ruby on Rails projects: primary, secondary and apiary.
Then let's configure Nginx, so that the are accessed in the following way.

| server    | port | location   |
|-----------+------+------------|
| primary   | 5050 | /          |
| secondary | 5010 | /secondary |
| apiary    | 5010 | /apiary    |


** Creating Projects
Now we have 3 folders for the projects.

After creating gemset for the project and installing rails gem, I will create 3
projects.

#+begin_example
  rails new ./primary
  rails new ./secondary
  rails new ./apiary
#+end_example
